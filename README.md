# v0.9
## Still to come:
- Add share buttons, Twitter, Facebook
- Reset to fresh user data values - fix strongest/weakest tracks
- Add credit to RCI on reference lap time page.


# Rate My Racing
By Kevin Chaplin

- Compare your Assetto Corsa Competizione lap times with 4 standards: Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze.
- Rating applied to your lap times at each circuit to see where you are strong and where you need to practice.
- Get an overall driver rating to help match you with the right class in league racing.
- Be awarded a special "rank" - a fun nickname that may or may not reflect your ability.
- Use the Pace Calculator to calculate your pace over a series of laps.

## Motivation

App created to help Assetto Corsa Competizione sim racers with the following issues:
  - Driver motivation to practice, especially weaker/less popular circuits.
  - Similarly, the lack of rounded abilities leading to drivers focussing on only a few key circuits for online racing.
  - Accurately matching drivers of similar abilities for league racing.
  - Lack of progress / levels in the sim compared to more game like titles (although there are some present in game, they plateau for mid to high level sim racers).

And of course for me, a chance to continue my web development studies in the pursuit of employment and improve my skills using the Svelte framework.

## Credits

Lap times for each category per circuit taken from Race Club International. https://www.racingclubinternational.com/
Currently awaiting feedback before project is made public.

## Wish-list

Ability to download/upload user data. This would help prevent users losing their data. Currently data is stored using localStorage which is not optimal.
  - Needs further investigation.
Ability to upload lap times from third party data-logging software to the Pace Calculator to calculate lap pace.
  - Not possible directly from the sim. Will have to check for software in use, and data formats, etc.
