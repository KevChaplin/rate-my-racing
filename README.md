# Rate My Racing
By Kevin Chaplin

Compare your Assetto Corsa Competizione lap times with 4 standards: Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze.
Rating applied to all circuits and a overall rating awarded using the average rating of all circuits.
In addition you will be awarded a special "rank", a bit of fun to perhaps demonstrate your ability. Each rating has 4 ranks associated with it.

## Motivation

App created to help drivers identify their weaker circuits and motivate drivers to become more rounded. Also, to give drivers motivation to practice and refine their lap times.
And for me, a chance to continue my web development studies in the pursuit of employment and improve my skills using the Svelte framework.
